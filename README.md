The "Uniaxial-Compression-Rock-Failure" script in this repository models and visualizes the stress-strain behavior of rock samples under uniaxial compression. The script calculates axial, circumferential, and volumetric strains based on experimental load data. It then generates plots showing stress versus these different strain types, highlighting key mechanical properties such as the elastic portion and yield point. Additionally, it computes and outputs important material parameters, including Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, providing a comprehensive analysis of the rock's mechanical response under compression.
